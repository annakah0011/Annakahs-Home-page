    </head>No man is an island,
Entire of itself,
Every man is a piece of the continent, <br> 
A part of the main.<br>
If a clod be washed away by the sea, <br> 
Europe is the less. <br> 
As well as if a promontory were.<br> 
As well as if a manor of thy friend’s
Or of thine own were:<br>
Any man’s death diminishes me,<br> 
Because I am involved in mankind, <br> 
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; <br>
It tolls for thee.
